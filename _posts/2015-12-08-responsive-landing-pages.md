In May of 2015, Marketo released their guided landing page editor with support for responsive landing page templates. Before this, you had to make due with non-repsonsive landing pages in order to use any of the Marketo widgets or analytics. There were workaround/hacks that you could do, but it was messy and difficult. Now we are able to create a seamless user experience across all devices and screensizes to generate leads and conversions.
